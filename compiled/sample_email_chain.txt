Hi Paul,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm writing to you today to discuss an upcoming project that we're working on.

As you know, we're developing a new platform that will provide alumni with access to events, thought leadership, and opportunities to engage with each other.

We're excited to announce that Paul McCartney will be giving a talk on the importance of data science.

Paul is a Professor of Practice of Data Science at Olin College of Engineering and is active in disseminating her knowledge and expertise with respect to statistics, data, and analytics through many different channels.

We believe that Paul's talk will be a valuable addition to our platform and will help our alumni to understand the importance of data science in their careers.

The talk will be held on Zoom on January 15th at 10am EST.

We hope that you will be able to attend.

Please RSVP to me by January 10th.

Thanks,
Andrew
